#!LISTS - sequence
#~ List is an ordered set of items
#~A negative index accesses items from the end of the list counting backwards a_list[-1]
#~Can use the 'in' operator to return whether a value appears in a list - it will return True or False
#~ Using the index() method tells you WHERE in the list a value appears. If value is not found the index()method will notify you by returning FALSE
